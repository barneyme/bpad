MARKDOWN
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.

**Basic Markdown formatting:**
# H1 heading
## H2 heading
**bold**
_italic_
* Bullet line
* Bullet list
[URL](www.address.com)

To convert Markdown to HTML you can use online tools like [Hashify.me](https://hashify.me) or [Dilinger](https://dillinger.io). Or you can install one of the many apps like [Notable](https://notable.md) or [WriteMonkey](http://writemonkey.com) or [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org).
